# Python-challenge
#In this python challenge, I had troubel trying to figure out where my code was making a mistake and realized the indentations matter which I was able to figure out using various tools across the internet. For example, other public repos and online forums like Stack Overflow. 

#I still had trouble pushing changes from my local repo in my terminal and will be setting up time in a tutoring session to get it right. I have changed my PAT key a few times now when trying to connect my local repo with github and it hasn't worked.
